/**
 * @fileoverview Client Entry Point for React Hydration
 *
 * @description
 * Handles client-side hydration of the server-rendered React application.
 * This file runs in the browser after the initial HTML is loaded, making
 * the static HTML interactive by attaching React event handlers.
 *
 * @architecture
 * Hydration Flow:
 * 1. Browser receives server-rendered HTML
 * 2. JavaScript bundle loads and executes
 * 3. This entry point hydrates the existing DOM
 * 4. React takes over and the app becomes interactive
 *
 * @performance
 * - Uses startTransition for non-blocking hydration (React 18+)
 * - Wrapped in StrictMode for development checks
 * - Preserves CSP nonce from server render
 *
 * @edge-case
 * Google Cache handling:
 * - Skips hydration for Google's webcache.googleusercontent.com
 * - This prevents issues with cached pages trying to hydrate
 *
 * @dependencies
 * - react-router/dom - Client-side router
 * - react-dom/client - React 18 hydration
 * - @shopify/hydrogen - CSP nonce provider
 *
 * @related
 * - entry.server.tsx - Server-side rendering counterpart
 * - root.tsx - Root component being hydrated
